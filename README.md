# ⚡ Distributed AgenticDAG

High-performance, **distributed DAG execution framework** built for **multi-machine agentic workflows**.

Run complex workflows as **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)** across a cluster of machines with **gRPC-based task dispatching**, and **scalable orchestration**.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 **Agentic Task Execution** – Define and execute intelligent tasks with dependencies.
- ⚡ **Master-Worker Architecture** – Scale horizontally across multiple machines.
- 🌐 **gRPC Communication** – Fast, reliable task dispatching and result collection.
- 🧵 **Thread-safe Worker Pool** – Efficient task distribution and fault tolerance.
- 🔥 **Bare-Metal & Cloud Ready** – Deploy on physical servers or cloud instances.
